### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm just a spare-time programmer, trying to have fun.
Commonly program in Python, JS, C and some C#.

Primarily enjoy:
- Messing with game theory
- Getting a headache from heuristics
- Snoozing my way through another discord bot

Still trying to get a proper grasp of Cython, networking and procedural generation.\
